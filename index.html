        <p>Hello,</p>
      </div>
      <div id="about">
        <p>I'm Mary Bryant, a senior at the University of Miami majoring in Public Relations with minors in Marketing and Psychology. Growing up in Alabama I didn't know much abut Public Relations, but through my classes and my involvement in student organizations at the University of Miami, I discovered my love for PR and developed important communication skills.</p>
      <div id=mb>
        <p>My involvement with the University of Miami’s Public Relations Experience Program allowed</p>

        <p>me to work at events in the Miami area including the WGC Cadillac Championship and</p>
        <p>NASCAR Championship Weekend. These experiences required me to communicate</p>
        <p>important information to guests and quickly resolve any issues that arose</p>
        <p>with media registration.I also gained experience with the University of</p>
        <p>Miami President’s 100. Leading admissions tours for the President's 100 requires strong</p>
        <p>interpersonal skills, flexibility and the ability to maintain a positive attitude as I am tasked</p>
        <p>with persuading students to attend the University and responding to the concerns of their</p>
        <p>family members.</p>
      </div>
        <p>Outside of class, I love yoga and  scuba diving with the University of Miami Scuba Club.</p>
        <div id=mb>
        <p>In addition to my experience, I am an advanced writer. I also have experience with Photoshop,</p>
        <p>InDesign and Illustrator, and am able to grasp software quickly.</p>
