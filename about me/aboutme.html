          <p>I am a senior at the University of Miami and I hope to pursue a career in public relations or marketing. Through my classes and my involvement in student organizations at the University of Miami, I discovered my love for PR and developed communication skills.</p>

<p>I gained strong communication skills and event experience through my involvement in student organizations at the University of Miami. I assisted with event opperations at several events in the Miami area through the University of Miami’s Public Relations Experience Program. This included working in the media center for NASCAR Championship Weekend, assisting with red carpets for galas, and working promotional events for a local comedy festival. This required me to communicate important information to guests and members of the media, and quickly resolve issues so the events ran smoothly. As a member of the President’s 100, I led admissions tours for the University. This required interpersonal skills, flexibility, and the ability to maintain a positive attitude while persuading students to attend the University and responding to the concerns of their family members.</p>

<p>In addition, I am an advanced writer and have experience preparing press releases, fact sheets, and other media materials through my public relations courses. I also have experience with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator, and am able to quickly grasp new software.</p>
