          <p>Hello,</p>
        </div>
        <div id=mb>
          <p>I'm Mary Bryant, a senior at the University of Miami majoring in Public Relations with minors in Marketing and Psychology. Growing up in Alabama I didn't know much abut Public Relations, but through my classes and my involvement in student organizations at the University of Miami, I discovered my love for PR and developed important communication skills.</p>
          <p>I am an advanced writer and gained experience preparing press releases, fact sheets, and other media material through my public relations courses. Additionally, I have experience with HTML and CSS software, Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator, and am able to quickly grasp new software.</p>
        </div>
          <div id=mb2>
          <p>My involvement with the University of Miami’s Public Relations Experience Program allowed me to work at events in the Miami area including the WGC Cadillac Championship and NASCAR Championship Weekend. These experiences required me to communicate important information to guests and quickly resolve any issues that arose with media registration.</p>
          <p>I also developed important skills as a member of the University of Miami President’s 100. Leading admissions tours for the President's 100 requires strong interpersonal skills, flexibility and the ability to maintain a positive attitude as I am tasked with persuading students to attend the University and responding to the concerns of their family members.</p>
          <p>Outside of class, I love yoga and  scuba diving with the University of Miami Scuba Club.</p>
