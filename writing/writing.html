  <h3>St. Jude Gala Feature for the Public Relations Experience Program</h3>
</div>
  <div>
    <div id=text>
​      <p>As local celebrities and prominent members of the Miami community made their way down the red carpet at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital It’s All About the Kids Gala, students in the Public Relations Experience Program made sure every aspect of the event ran smoothly.</p>
      <p>Guests were greeted by PREP students’ smiling faces as they entered the JW Marriot Marquis Hotel for the gala on Saturday, Oct. 1. The event raises money for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, which provides medical care to sick children regardless of their family’s ability to pay for treatment.</p>
      <p>PREP students checked-in media, assisted photographers, and even conducted interviews with the gala’s VIP guests, as well as managed the traffic flow on the red carpet. The size of the gala and the 30-foot red carpet meant the PREP team had to be ready to work. Newcomers to PREP Dalia Paskin, Sophia Dacharry, and Elyse Waterman assisted St. Jude and World Red Eye staff photographers for the night. Theresa Burton and Evelyn Pang worked with PREP veteran Cat Coleman to run the red carpet. Although a senior, Parker Yates is new to PREP and helped with the media check-in. Veterans Mary Bryant Fleming and Jess Clavero supervised the students and worked with the staff from St. Jude.</p>
<p>“I got to interview a few local TV celebrities which was a surreal experience,” said public relations major Michael Zubizarreta, who spent the night serving as the videographer’s assistant. The gala was Zubizarreta’s first PREP event, and he was excited to learn about all of the behind-the-scenes production involved in red carpet events.<p>
